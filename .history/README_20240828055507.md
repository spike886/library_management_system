# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a web application built with Rails 7.2. It provides user authentication/registration using devise, and authorization using . Librarians have the capability to add, edit, and delete books, as well as monitor all borrowings and manage returns. Members can borrow books, track their due dates, and view their borrowing history.

Key features include a searchable book catalog, where users can find books by title, author, or genre. The system also tracks book availability and ensures that members cannot borrow the same book multiple times. A dedicated dashboard presents relevant information: Librarians see total books, borrowed books, and overdue items, while Members view their borrowed books and due dates.

The application supports a RESTful API for CRUD operations on books and borrowings and integrates JWT for secure API access. It also features pagination for book listings and uses Faker for generating seed data, enhancing usability and testing. The project is containerized with Docker and includes thorough documentation for setup and usage.
